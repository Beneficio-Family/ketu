# ketu

Little library to compute positions of astronomical bodies (Sun, Moon, planets and mean Node aka Rahu), generate time series and calendars based on planetaries aspects.

Need pyswisseph: `pip install pyswisseph` and numpy: `pip install numpy`

At the moment, compute bodies positions and aspects for a date, interactively.

Run `python ketu.py` and answer the questions.

**TODO:** find datetimes for beginning, end and exact aspect and find all aspects between two dates.
